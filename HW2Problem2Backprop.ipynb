Use markdown cells with latex for equations of a jupyter notebook for each proof for \"a.\" and \"b.\". Make sure you include text that explains your steps. Next for \"c\" this is an implementation problem. You need to understand and modify the code the Michael Nielsen provided so that instead it is using a matrixed based approach. Again don't keep the biases separate. After reading data in (use the iris data set), create a new column corresponding to $x_0=1$, and as mentioned above and discussed in class (see notes) is that the bias term can then be considered a weight $w_0$. Again use markdown cells around your code and comments to explain your work. Test the code on the iris data set with 4 node input (5 with a constant 1), three hidden nodes, and three output nodes, one for each species/class."],"metadata":{"id":"xuuA_SHMuUne"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## a.
