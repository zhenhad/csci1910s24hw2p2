Next for \"c\" this is an implementation problem. You need to understand and modify the code the Michael Nielsen provided so that instead it is using a matrixed based approach. Again don't keep the biases separate. After reading data in (use the iris data set), create a new column corresponding to $x_0=1$, and as mentioned above and discussed in class (see notes) is that the bias term can then be considered a weight $w_0$. Again use markdown cells around your code and comments to explain your work. Test the code on the iris data set with 4 node input (5 with a constant 1), three hidden nodes, and three output nodes, one for each species/class."],"metadata":{"id":"xuuA_SHMuUne"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## a.
